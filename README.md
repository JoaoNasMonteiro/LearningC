# LearningC
Welcome to my C learning journey!

This repo is essentially an amalgamation of my efforts to wrap my head around the C programming language, it's challenges and use cases.

I am approaching this from the perspective of someone that already has some programming expperience, although limited to simple scripting and whatever i have learned from the entry-level academic courses i have taken.

My end-goal is to become better at C for low-level systems development (especially working with IOT devices), networking and overall programming, eventally applying this knowledge on malware analysis.

My main sources for this work have been:
- [learn-c.org](learn-c.org) for the initial learning process and reminding myself about the basic syntax
- [Bro Code's C Programming Full Course at YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xND0t1pr3KY) for the same reasons and for some project ideas
- [Victor Huerlimann's Embedded Systems and Operating System Development at Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/create-your-own-embedded-operating-system/?kw=embedded+systems+and+opera&src=sac&couponCode=KEEPLEARNINGBR)

The overall plans for the course can be found over at PLANO.md (beware they are in portuguese and may be changed/not followed 100% of the time lol).
